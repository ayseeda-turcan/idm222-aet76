            <h1>Steam Redesign Case Study</h1>
            
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Steam, a leading digital distribution platform for video games, is known for 
                    its vast library and engaged user base. However, users have voiced concerns 
                    over its confusing layouts, inconsistent design elements, and cluttered homepage. 
                    This redesign aims to address these issues and create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience.</p>
                <p><b>My Role:</b> User research, wireframing, prototyping, and visual design.</p>
