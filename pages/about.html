                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am an undergraduate student studying User Experience & Interaction Design at Drexel
                    University with a strong foundation in interaction design, information architecture, and user-
                    centered design principles. Experienced in conducting user research, creating wireframes and
                    prototypes, and usability testing. Passionate about creating intuitive, user-friendly designs that
                    enhance user satisfaction and engagement.

                        What drew me to UX specifically is the opportunity to bridge the gap between technology and human 
                        experience. Functionality alone isn’t enough; usability is everything. And UX design allows me to 
                        translate how people think and behave into intuitive, thoughtful products that can genuinely 
                        improve their lives. It’s a field where problem-solving, creativity, and empathy come together, and 
                        knowing that a small design decision can make someone’s day a little easier is what makes this work so fulfilling.

                </br>
                    <p>When I’m not deep in design mode, you’ll probably find me sketching, trying out a new recipe, snapping photos of 
                        little everyday moments, or catching up on comics. I love having creative outlets outside of UX, 
                        it keeps things fresh and inspires me in unexpected ways.
